# TOPS
My experiences and course work at the enriched math and science TOPS program @ Marc Garneau Collegiate Insitute (Class of '21).

I wasn't able to experience grade 12 TOPS because of the pandemic :P but certain courses in grade 12 TOPS are similar to the enriched courses I took in grade 12. The exceptions are:
- Physics: Grade 12 TOPS Physics is enriched **significantly** beyond (even enriched) grade 12 Physics. The grade 12 TOPS physics teacher (Mr. van Bemmel as of 2021) teaches a course that is enriched beyond the AP curriculum.
- Calculus: We take calculus in grade 11 TOPS in the "Advanced Functions" course. The Grade 12 "Calculus & Vectors" course is a lot broader than calculus and typically goes through first-year linear algebra.
- Chemistry: I wasn't able to take grade 12 chem, but my grade 12 chem "enriched" course was pretty much the grade 11 TOPS chem course (kinetics was the only new unit if I recall correctly).

The above is a non-exhuastive list about what's different in *Grade 12* TOPS. If you have questions about what makes TOPS different, I'd recommend reaching out to the curriculum leader (Currently Ms. Hermanovsky if I recall correctly). If you're interested in a student's perspective, feel free to message me at dhrumilp15@gmail.com or dhrumilp15#4369 on discord and we'll set up a call. :)

I'm posting these mainly for the many students who have asked me about grade X(usually 11 or 12) TOPS work. :)
