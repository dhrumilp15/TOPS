# TOPS
My experiences and course work at TOPS @ Marc Garneau Collegiate Insitute (Class of '21)

I wasn't able to experience grade 12 TOPS because of the pandemic :P but certain courses in grade 12 TOPS are similar to the enriched courses I took in grade 12. The exceptions are:
- Physics: Grade 12 Physics in TOPS is a far, far, **far** cry from grade 12 Physics. The physics with the grade 12 physics teacher in TOPS (Mr. van Bemmel) is enriched beyond the AP curriculum, but I'm not sure if that will continue since he's retiring this year (2021).
- Calculus: We take calculus in grade 11 TOPS in the "Advanced Functions" course. The Grade 12 "Calculus & Vectors" course is a lot broader than calculus and typically goes through first-year linalg.
- Chemistry: I wasn't able to take grade 12 chem, but my grade 12 chem "enriched" course was pretty much the grade 11 TOPS chem course (New units were mainly kinetics).

This is a non-exhuastive list about what's different in *Grade 12* TOPS from "enriched" school. If you're really interested in understanding the differences between TOPS and regular school, I'd recommend either reaching out to the curriculum leader (Currently Ms. Hermanovsky if I recall correctly). If you're interested in a student's perspective, feel free to contact me at dhrumilp15@gmail.com (or dhrumilp15#4369 on discord) and we'll set up a call. :)

I'm posting these mainly for the many younger students who have asked me about grade X(usually 11 or 12) TOPS work. :)
