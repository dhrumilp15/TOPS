# TOPS
My experiences and course work at TOPS @ Marc Garneau Collegiate Insitute (Class of '21)

I wasn't able to experience grade 12 TOPS because of the pandemic :P but these files were taking up space on my disk and I didn't know where else to put them.

I'm providing these files without any thought to what happens to them, so don't use them for nefarious purposes :smile:. I'm posting these partly for many of the younger students who want to get a taste for grade X(usually 11 or 12) TOPS work.
